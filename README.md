# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the R language.}

I have developed two R programs to enhance my software engineering skills. The first, 'Data Scraper',  retrieves data from a Wikipedia page listing towns and cities in England by population. It uses the rvest package for web scraping. Second program, is 'Text Analyzer', serves as a  Natural Language Processor (NLP) tool. It  performs tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and word cloud generation. 
 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote these two programs to learn the richness of R programming language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment.
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used the R language and  several libraries; rvest for web scraping , tm for text mining operations, and wordcloud for generating visual word clouds from text data.
# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
There are several ways I could improve these two programs
- Enhance the functionality of the web scraper to handle more complex website structures and extract more data points.
- Improve the text analyzing capabilities by incorporating more advanced natural language processing techniques.
- Add support for analyzing text from multiple sources, such as files or online content.
